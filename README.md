# Welcome to Hope School - a grading system for teachers!

I built this app based on Hope Schools, a school located in East London, South Africa that teaches children who are infected, affected and/or orphaned by HIV/AIDS. More info here: https://www.facebook.com/pg/hopeschoolsza/about/?ref=page_internal

I traveled with my church twice in 2017 on a short-term missionary trip to share God's love in a practical way with the children. We sang and danced to Christian songs, taught them valuable lessons from the Bible, and made light repairs to the school's building.

## General Information

This app uses the following tech stack:

- Ruby 2.6.3

- Rails 5.2.3

- RSpec 3.8.2 - testing on the models/database

- PostgreSQL - for deployment to Heroku

- Bcrypt - with has_secure_password for simple authentication

- Bootstrap - for simple styling

- OAuth login with Google and Facebook

## Demo
